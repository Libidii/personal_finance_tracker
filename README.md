# personal_finance_tracker
First repo on github ever. I want to build a tracker using Python to help me manage my finances (subscriptions, bills, exceptional expenses, spendable amount display, etc ... ). 

I'm doing this in the context of a roadmap.sh challenge you can find here : https://roadmap.sh/projects/expense-tracker.

More than a personal tool, this project is to help me get better at programming (in Python but also in general CS-thinking).
I have a "scientific"/"engineering" programming background (as a student) so I know a few things on how to calculate, visualize, manage data with Python. But OOP, app/web development are completely untouched for me. 

Feel free to give me advice :D
Have a nice day !
